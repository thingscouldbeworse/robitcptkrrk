Next time you start a campaign don't bother with the tutorial since you've played it once, and you'll be able to play the opening mission yourself to try and make sure you come out of it with 4 squaddies. \n\nAs some general advice, here are a couple things to keep in mind:\n\nCover is omni-important in this game. Try your best to not shoot at your enemies from half-cover unless you have more troops behind the first shooter to back him/her up. \n\nFlanking gives you incredible bonuses to your accuracy in shooting, but also in your chances of scoring a critical hit. DON'T let your units get flanked. Before you make a move, watch out for the alien movement ranges. If you move to one side of a building and there's an alien close to the opposite corner, he can easily move to a corner where he flanks you and you have nothing on him. If you don't have a good cover situation in front of you, be ready to retreat, regroup, skirt to the side, and try and get your own flanking position. \n\nA squad wipeout sucks, and you should do your best to prevent it, but bad moves can lead to a shitty situation, and you can end up with everyone dead. When/if this happens, you need backups, you need a B-team. On your first mission you'll hopefully end up with 3 or 4 squaddies, and you don't want to end up with ANY other mission that you only have rookies on. For your second mission bring 2 or 3 of your squaddies and 1 or 2 rookies. Support the rookies and make sure they get their 1 or 2 kills for a promotion (depends on which difficulty setting you're playing on). Do this for any mission with a difficulty setting you feel comfortable taking on with say, 2 of your best guys, one middling guy, and one newbie. The key here is to spread out the XP so you never have the situation you just described.\n\nMissions show up by scanning and then choosing, that's just a quirk you'll have to get used to. As the game heats up you'll treasure that time in between missions because it's where your research and engineering projects approach completion.

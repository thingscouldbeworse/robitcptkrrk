Next time you start a campaign don't bother with the tutorial since you've played it once, and you'll be able to play the opening mission yourself to try and make sure you come out of it with 4 squaddies. \n\nAs some general advice, here are a couple things to keep in mind:\n\nCover is omni-important in this game. Try your best to not shoot at your enemies from half-cover unless you have more troops behind the first shooter to back him/her up. \n\nFlanking gives you incredible bonuses to your accuracy in shooting, but also in your chances of scoring a critical hit. DON'T let your units get flanked. Before you make a move, watch out for the alien movement ranges. If you move to one side of a building and there's an alien close to the opposite corner, he can easily move to a corner where he flanks you and you have nothing on him. If you don't have a good cover situation in front of you, be ready to retreat, regroup, skirt to the side, and try and get your own flanking position. \n\nA squad wipeout sucks, and you should do your best to prevent it, but bad moves can lead to a shitty situation, and you can end up with everyone dead. When/if this happens, you need backups, you need a B-team. On your first mission you'll hopefully end up with 3 or 4 squaddies, and you don't want to end up with ANY other mission that you only have rookies on. For your second mission bring 2 or 3 of your squaddies and 1 or 2 rookies. Support the rookies and make sure they get their 1 or 2 kills for a promotion (depends on which difficulty setting you're playing on). Do this for any mission with a difficulty setting you feel comfortable taking on with say, 2 of your best guys, one middling guy, and one newbie. The key here is to spread out the XP so you never have the situation you just described.\n\nMissions show up by scanning and then choosing, that's just a quirk you'll have to get used to. As the game heats up you'll treasure that time in between missions because it's where your research and engineering projects approach completion.

Text being written on the screen is very easy for a human to understand, but is nothing like what a computer understands. You've probably heard that computers have to run using binary, 1s and 0s, that's pure computer language, running directly on hardware (as the 1s and 0s represent actual electrical signals). A step above that is hexidecimal, a base 16 system (as opposed to binary's base 2 and our arabic base 10) that uses numbers 1 through 9 and letters A through F to represent numbers. Hexidecimal is easier for humans to understand than binary, and it's pretty close binary so computers can understand it easily. \n\nNow when you're working on relatively primitive hardware like the gameboy (primitive in comparison to the computers they were using to make the game) you have to worry about limits in space, in this case the issue being that the game needed to fit onto the cartridge. When you use language that humans understand but not computers, such as writing a line of code in english, it has to be translated down through levels of abstraciton into something the computer can understand. This is really inneficient because each step of the process is going to create extra stuff that isn't neccisarily needed. So to utilize all the space they were given, instead of writing everything in an easy to understand programming language (say, writing a line like [print \"what is your name\"]) and then translating it through a compiler into computer language ( a whole page of hexidecimal) they just wrote it in hexadecimal to begin with in order to save space. It's a real dedication effeciency, and it paid off big time in this case.\n\nEDIT: as /u/otaia pointed out below, no one would write code in just hexadecimal, they'd write it in [assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) which is closer to an actual step just above binary.", "id": "cdhannv"}, {"body": "We really should just have a bot that submits the comic a soon as it gets posted.

Combat with creatures wasn't something I didn't want to see at all, but it was more of a hypothetical than anything. I remember playing survival test and thinking \"yeah, I could see this becoming kind of interesting when it's finished up\", but that feeling never really went away as updates kept coming all the way up through beta. Fighting enemies still felt like it was an unfinished feature to be completed later. Which was fine, a lot of minecraft's copies were sold on unfinished promises of later features, and I didn't mind, but I always assumed that there would be some kind of major overhaul to the way players and NPCs interacted and fought. \n\nAnd so when the adventure update was teased I, and a lot of other people who had been playing since early on, got really excited that this was the update to really fix the inadequacies of the MC combat system, to give it the level of polish and attention that world generation had been given, to elevate it to a \"back-of-box\" feature of the game.\n\nAnd that is about as far away from what happened as possible. Instead of getting and update that fixed what was (and still is) essentially a placeholder for a feature, we got a bunch of nonsensical design choices and unnesicary bells and whistles dumped on top of a broken system. Enemies still cluster around your house, pressing against the walls and playing the exact same grating sound over and over and over again. They still bounced around like dead eyed blow up dolls with about 2 frames of animation for their walk cycle and zero for any kind of wind up or attack pattern, and now you were expected to do the same so that to do any damage in combat, so your view is constantly bobbing around like you fight with springs on your feet, which makes the already abysmal hitbox detection seem somehow even worse. The basics of combat didn't change in the least, if there's two or fewer enemies you just sit there and mash attack keeping them out of range with the knockback, and if there's more then run away and kite them. It's soooo boring. There's absolutely zero skill involved and it's just so incredibly tedious. The Adventure Update certainly didn't make combat worse, but instead of meaningful changes to a broken system it just layered all this nonsense on top so that you now have to put up with the terrible system in order to get XP (and yes I know they later added in XP from mining coal, but that just lets you ignore the shitty way of getting XP for the boring way).\n\nThe food overhaul wasn't very good either, it gave more reasons for setting up farms, but all it really did was make the first couple days before you have wheat growing marginally more difficult. After that it's difficult to not have more food than you'd ever need, and it just adds another pointless amount of tedium to everyday tasks so that instead of just mining, you have to stop every couple minutes to shove an entire loaf of bread down your throat to keep your sprint at the ready in case you have to kite enemies.\n\nAll in all, the adventure update was a massive letdown for those who were hoping to have the more boring and broken parts of Minecraft somewhat rectified or streamlined, but instead they were accentuated so that they stick out more now, but still feel aggravating to use.

That's a really obvious and obtuse example but not the only way it can be portrayed. It's also not always a bad thing, Spec Ops: The Line used LND to let you kill a lot of people and then carry an anti-violent message in order to make a statement about how violence is used as simple fun filler in games. \n\nIn Infinite, no one is trying to say that Booker himself condemns the violence (at least not to begin with), we're saying that messages carried by the game condemn certain kinds of violence. The enemies and antagonists's acts of violence are condmened and used to make them into villians, while Booker's violence is seen as a means to an end. The game presents you with no other option other than to kill your way forward, and remember that he's not always just killing Comstock's police force, he's killing Columbia's citizens after they turn on him for stealing things, he kills a former friend just because, he kills rebels that just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The only interaction you as a player ever have with anything else is in fighting and killing it.\n\nAnd Elizabeth plays a part in this too. She abhors the violence exhibited by Booker for all of one scene before passively sitting back and watching him kill countless others and then eventually killing a rebel leader herself. The issue here isn't that a violent character exists, but that violence is used to solve ALL of your problems despite the enemies being despised for specific acts of violence\n\nAnd secondly, that the gameplay mechanics of killing people never change to reflect Booker's changes in character. Halfway through he decides that he's not the old Booker and he's going to be different, but you still only, exclusively kill people from that point onwards. If violence shows us how condemable Booker is when he's still the old Wounded-Knee Booker, how come when he has a change of heart he remains the same in killing?", "id": "ch2nxbe"}, {"body": "The \"He's just doing it to make people laugh\" really gets under my skin.

Nintendo has been phenomenally terrible at getting third party support for a while now, and ever since the gamecube has had a steep decline in new IPs. Instead they seem content to simply rehash their established brands over and over again, counting on nostalgia value to keep fans around. Think about everything they revealed at E3, a sequel to Starfox, a not at all surprising Zelda sequel the *17th* in the series, some information about the 4th Smash Bros. game, and a new kid friendly IP that [seems to be based off of old XBLA shovelware](https://www.behance.net/gallery/862483/Color-Wars-). Nintendo has steadfastly refused to innovate in their games library, make any concessions to allow for better 3rd Party titles, or even create a competent online service.

Assuredly this is because the Vox took things too far and killed innocents. If not then they're bad for... their angry rhetoric?\n\n>Elizabeth gets initially upset at you for killing a dude and runs away\n\nand then *nothing*. Elizabeth exhibits no inhibitions over killing from that point on. And it's definitely not only a self defense case, in many cases you can just walk into someone's house, pick up food from their table, and they will just throw themselves at you. And Elizabeth doesn't care that you just murdered two innocents. Even using the incredibly lazy excuse of \"Booker is a violent man\" Elizabeth would obviously have done something.

That way, if people want to buy your new game they'll HAVE to buy our console!\". No one wins from that relationship. The people that happened to buy that specific console go \"Whew, glad that haphazard, shortsighted bet I made managed to pay off\" and anyone who didn't buy the console says \"Well shit, I really do hope that bribe had some kind of time limit attached to it so a couple months down the line I'll be able to also play that game.\" Which is EXACTLY what we're seeing happen with Capcom games now.

You can't really draw a line that applies to everyone, only something that's useful to yourself. In this case, I'm actually not sure how much I'd apply \"you just didn't get it\" to the BunnyHop video, because it's not so much that he didn't \"get\" Spec Ops as much as he was looking at things from a pure \"how do the mechanics make you feel\" aspect, and didn't think about how the narrative of Spec Ops contextualizes the actions you take within the game. \n\nAnd in the case of Bioshock Infinite, I don't think the same thing applies because in the end it really doesn't matter whether the designers purposefully hamstrung the Vigors and made all of your mechanical choices meaningless, because whatever their reason behind the actions it ended up being a major detriment to the game. Infinite makes the same mistakes Bioshock 1 did in that it doesn't really have anything to say about the themes and motifs within it, it just has them kind of... there, lying around. Yes there are a lot of meaningless choices in the game, but the narrative never actually makes a point about the nature of choice (or for that matter nationalism, racism, violence, or any of the other themes lying around the game), and actually goes out of its way to make choices and their consequences a central and driving part of the plot. And then the fact that there is no meaningful change in gameplay regardless of which vigors, weapons, clothes or upgrades you use makes actually slogging through the combat slow and tedious. I never once felt engaged with Bioshock Infinite's mechanics, and I was constantly angry at just how aggravating the combat felt and how I as a player had no real way to change that, yet the characters in cutscenes and scripted sequences made big sweeping changes and exerted an incredible amount of power. \n\nEven if all of that was intended, even if Irrational set out to make gameplay that was boring and frustrating on purpose, even if they planned on removing all of the nuance and player driven gameplay from the previous game, that doesn't somehow excuse it. Distinguishing between what was meant to happen and what wasn't is important, but it doesn't excuse bad design. That's like my Drive example, I have no doubt that Nicholas Refn purposefully wrote a slow script with tons of scene direction for Ryan Gosling to stare into space whenever possible, but that doesn't mean the final product isn't a piece of shit. It just means that that's how Refn makes movies, by setting up a bunch of very interesting, well shot scenes, and then stringing them together with a 4th grader's attempt at a plot.

Every publication's score is given an equal weight on the scale\n\n2.) Every publication's score is converted to a 10 point scale.\n\n3.) Publications that don't give out scores are totally ignored.\n\nOn that first point; this means that if you take two publications who both came to the same conclusion at the end of their review (say, that the game was average) can end up rating it differently. A lot of places assign a 6/10 or even a 7/10 as \"average\" while others will keep it at 5/10. But the scores look really different, you have a 10 to 20 point disparity there. \n\nAnd the point disparity shows up all over the place. Publications that more often rate using fractional measurements fit into the metacritic system easily, but there's rarely any real difference between a 7/10 and a 7.5/10 on the reviewing end of things, but all that gets magnified because metacritic has to raise every score by an order of magnitude.\n\nExcept in the cases where it actually has to multiply more than 10, such as publications that rate out of 5 instead of 10. A 9/10 and a 4/5 mean roughly the same thing, one point away from a perfect score, but they get weighted completely differently. That 4/5 gets turned into an 8/10, a totally different score. And if that publication wants to properly represent it as a 9/10 they have to start scoring things as 4.5/5, which is an even more different score. Now we're only half a point away from a perfect, but That's also not represented in metacritic, so really we need a 4.75/5 to get a 9.5/10. Anyone who scores out of 5 has their score completely misrepresented, not to mention publications that almost never give out perfect 10's versus ones that give them out all the time.\n\nIt also misconstrues a 10 point system as somehow equivalent to a 100 point grading system. We think of a 75 as about a 'C' (at least if you're coming from most school systems) but that's not really an accurate grade. Most people agree that 10 point systems for games are really just 5 point systems with an extra 5 'shame-points' tacked on (everyone knows what a game scoring a 5/10 is, it's a \"don't buy\" so anything below 5 is just a way to add in more insults) unless of course you're that publication from earlier that treats a 5/10 as average, which you readers know but metacritic doesn't and doesn't represent accordingly. In fact a game rated on that scale as \"below average\" (say a 3.5) DRASTICALLY changes the final metacritic score. If you have three publications saying that game is average and assigning a 7/10 average, and then our below average score, the mean score is ~61. That makes no sense, and doesn't accurately portray the game. What those scores *actually* tell us, is that 3 publications rated the game \"favorable\" and one rated it \"unfavorable\", a 75% favorable. That is a MUCH more accurate portrayal. \n\nWhich brings us to the second point, with everything being weighted the same, you're actually giving more power to publications that rate games drastically lower, because they have the ability to influence the score with how much they disliked the game. A metacritic score will hover around the average of the first couple publications, but then plummet from one reviewer who didn't like it. And not even! The reviewer just had to miss something, or not like that genre, or just be bad at it. Any number of random reasons can come up to make someone rate a game low, and thus lower the overall score just because of some changing circumstances. \n\nAnd not only can they change it, but they have a direct power given to them to change *how much* the score changes. Their review isn't just added on as an \"unfavorable\", it's added on as a 3/10, or a 2/10, or even a 0/10. And so the overall metacritic score is held hostage by the level of dislike one reviewer had for a certain game, when really the accurate way to show that data is at a large amount of people thought \"favorably\" about a game, and then a minority thought \"unfavorably\" of it. \n\nAnd these fucking misrepresented, piece of shit, near useless measures of a game's worth mean a LOT. [Bonuses for some developers are given out based on the game's performance on metacritic.](http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/15/obsidian-missed-fallout-new-vegas-metacritic-bonus-by-one-point/) that distinction between a 4/5 and a 9/10 is amplified to ridiculous, actual, real money implications. \n\nAnd everyone who doesn't give a score gets shut out. If you're an independent reviewer who doesn't think you should use an objective measurement to measure inherently subjective things (games, movies, music) then you're voice isn't heard. If you're a publication that actually wants its readers to read their reviews and not just skip to the score verdict, your voice isn't heard. It's only large, click-bait publications that end up forging the score that everyone sees. \n\nAnd people still use metacritic to judge a game's worth! They want metacritic scores added to reddit tables, to Steam store pages, to whatever. People are so desperate to have a number for things, to quantify totally un-quantafiable aspects to justify their purchases. \n\nSo yes, it is a better system to tell people to go hunting through the haystack of google results and youtube. If after 10 minutes of gameplay videos, amateur and professional reviews, you still need someone to spoonfeed you a number that will tell you what to do you don't need a new videogame to play, you need a fucking sandwich or something else that won't pose any difficult decisions for you to make. \n\nRegardless of whether a better system exists yet, people need to stop using metacritic scores. Metacritic isn't a social network, it's not something people are going to jump from to another, it's a system that started up in a climate where there wasn't an equivalent, and we can easily go back to not using it. Whether someone builds an alternative doesn't really matter, it's far more important to stop using broken tools. \n\nAnd you're not adding any more substantive backups to your stance that metacritic is useful, but I'm not downvoting your posts, because I'm not a child.", "id": "crgly8c"}, {"body": "Lol aren't you the exact type of person we're talking about?", "id": "cr43n4l"}, {"body": "Are you seriously implying that Afghanistan and the US have the same level of control by the in power government?", "id": "cqy1vn1"}, {"body": "I mean as long as you can justify your own eugenics belief, then I guess that works for you", "id": "cqwbx7l"}, {"body": "You should be more informed about the person you support. \n\n[Rand Paul supports killing American citizens without trial via drone missile strikes](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-27/rand-paul-defends-drone-killings-of-americans-in-al-qaeda)\n\n[Rand Paul thinks the government should play a role in restricting abortions](http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/rand-paul-government-should-play-a-role-in-restricting-abortion-20150416).

This completely invalidates the end of Portal! GLaDOS singing Still Alive, the visceral death of her at Chell's hands, Chell's sacrifice to get out of Aperture, it's all washed down the drain for the sake of putting Chell back at square one so that Portal 2 can happen. \n\n\nThat REALLY bothers me, both from the standpoint of someone who loved Portal 1 and from a principled standpoint about creative media. Pieces of media being retconned in order let the company make a new game with all the fan recognition is really troubling.\n\nIf Valve really wanted to make a sequel to Portal they should have found a way to do that without going back and throwing out the original vision of Portal 1. And they almost did! They had a game in development under the name \"Portal 2\" that didn't feature Chell or GLaDOS or even portals at all.

But hey, I guess we can also ignore the fact that Grayson is also credited in the game itself.\n\nHis name appears in the credits because he donated. You knew that, but you brought it up anyway because you think it helps your point. He once listed her game in a list. You also knew this, but continue to try and misrepresent that.\n\n>But that being said, you continually say it's about her infidelity, no it wasn't. It wasn't about her infidelity as nobody cared about that. People only cared about the implications her relationship had with the coverage of video games in the journalist side. Failing to mention this is just an attempt to shift the topic onto something that was never an issue to begin with.\n\nAgain, you didn't read my comment. Or you somehow didn't understand it. Try to read this line again:\n>I didn't say that. I said that there were numerous scandals concerning games journalism before that, but none of them gained traction until there was one involving a woman and accusations of infidelity. \n\nIf you still can't understand what I'm saying, I'm sorry, I can't help you with that.\n\n>My reference towards Milo was lost on you, I was attempting to explain in a manner that what happened with GG embracing Milo has nothing to do with them being conservative, I know plenty of GG people within it who are in fact very liberal, I myself am a technocrat... hell you even have feminists within the GG group such as Liana Kerzner. The point was is that GG embracing Milo has more to do with the liberal left cannibalizing itself as opposed to it being conservative.\n\nThe classic reddit \"Wait is the plural of 'anecdote' not 'statistics'?\" argument. And it still doesn't change what I said, both about how Milo simply flipped over to GG's side when he realized he could con them, and how I said that GG is all about moral panic. \n\n>That being said, Aurini is not a proclaimed white-supremacist... the very idea that he is is just absurd. I personally don't like Aurini or his politics, but to make bold claims that have to do with taking his statement of being \"a white-supremacist on paper\" which was merely meant to be a jab against the various tumblr/identity politics idiots that must have people agree with them 99% of the time or be a racist/sexist/homophobe/xenophobe when it isn't true to begin with is lost on people.\n\nYeah... no. Someone who has said \"You should be absolutely furious about the niggers\", \"White's had been working to eliminate slavery [...] and even when we bought the slaves we treated them very well\" and then says he's a White supremacist \"on paper\"... yeah, you're not going to convince anyone that he isn't a white supremacist. \n\n>So your notion that GG is conservative makes absolutely no sense, given that you have more people from the left libertarian or left perspectives than those that are conservative. Your idea of a conservative movement is that a few people within it that are well known and are also conservative somehow make it a conservative movement? Newsflash: Movements meant to indicate that journalists be held accountable and artists be able to create whatever content they wish without fearing censorship from the right or the left is an inherently anti-authoritarian issue. And any attempt to turn that into anything else is inherently an issue with people embracing identity politics and nothing more.\n\nKiA upvotes Breitbart content, Aurini, they have massive overlap with /r/conservative and /r/libertarian. You having a couple friends who you consider liberal does not change the fact that the movement is regressive in nature.\n\nBut none of that matters.

", "id": "cpykt7b"}, {"body": "I would agree with you on most other points, but not on GG. For a couple reasons. First off, there aren't \"two sides\" here, there's just people who support GG, those who don't care, and those who dismiss it outright. And you won't see any of the people who don't care asking for a discussion, it's exclusively people who support GG, albeit sometimes by starting off with \"no I'm totally neutral, for sure\". \n\nBut mainly, everything that can be said about GG has already been said. From the start the entire \"movement\" was an utter embarrassment for gaming and it hasn't changed since. There where tons of people who cared about journalistic integrity before GG, there will continue to be tons who care even after /r/Kotakuinaction has circlejerked itself into obscurity. From the Giantbomb firing, to paid scores, to the infamous Doritos and Mt. Dew Halo video, there were lots of people talking about games journalism all throughout the late 2000s, without mainstream recognition.\n\nThe one thing that finally changed this, the one inciting incident that got nerds on the internet angry about it, was accusations of a woman's infidelity. After YEARS of total radio silence from most gaming fans, the single event that spurred a real outrage ended up being a story about an eeeevil woman using her eeeevil sex powers to get ahead. And of course, the story turned out to be 100% fabricated.\n\nAnd *to this day*, KiA's biggest boogiemen remain Quinn and Sarkeesian, two people who \n\n1.) Of course just happen to be women\n\n2.) Are not game's journalists\n\n3.) have little to no actual clout in the circles they move in, *except for all of the publicity that GG has given them*. Very few people who care about social progressiveness in gaming give a shit about either of these two people (I know I sure don't).\n\nNot to mention GG continually associates itself with people like Milo Yiannopoulos, a journalist who [has blamed shooting rampages on video games](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/05/27/virgin-killer-was-not-a-misogynist-but-a-madman/) and [accused gamers of being rapists before](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/08/14/players-as-young-as-12-and-13-are-being-raped-by-dorky-weirdos-on-grand-theft-auto/) and people like [David Aurini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsdIHK8O5yo), a sexist, racist, neo-confederate. \n\nShould you be concerned about ethics in game journalism? Sure. Should you be worried about the effect of advertising dollars on game reviews and content. Most definitely.\n\nBut neither of these issues hold any relevance to GG at this point, and anyone who is serious about journalistic integrity is distancing themselves as much as possible from GG. There is nothing to be gained from associating with a movement as outright toxic and disgusting as GG.\n\nDiscussion about disclosure in the realm of game coverage? Sure, that's welcome. But don't attach it to GG, and *please* don't imply that \"if you cared about ethics in game journalism you would stand with GG\".

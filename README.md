#Little pet robot

uses reddit and twitter python api bindings to get reddit comments from /u/thingscouldbeworse and then the markovify python library to make new phrases and post them to twitter. Will reply to any @ within 2 minutes (API ratelimiting notwithstanding). goGetEm() lets my twitter account specify another user which the bot will go and bother. Posts with an 80% chance three times a day between 9-11am, 1-3pm, and 5-7pm.
